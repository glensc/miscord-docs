description: Hello! What's Miscord?

# Introduction

Miscord is a highly configurable and easy to use bridge between Discord and Messenger. It uses [`libfb`](https://github.com/ChatPlug/libfb) and [`discord.js`](https://discord.js.org/) libraries, it's written in TypeScript and runs basically on any system that supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), including Android phones and Raspberry Pi.

Miscord is currently built by myself, [Bjornskjald](https://bjorn.ml). If you have any skills and free time, any contributions to the code are welcome. If you don't know a thing coding or can't help that way, you might donate on [PayPal](https://paypal.me/Bjornskjald), [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/miscord) or [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Bjornskjald).
